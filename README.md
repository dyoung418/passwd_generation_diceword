# passwd_generation_diceword

This is a quick program to generate a diceware password.  More information on diceware can be found
at <http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html>.

Note that the author of Diceware recommends using real, physical dice to generate these
passwords, not a random number generator as this does.  I suggest that you follow that
recommendation.  This was written for other uses that are less critical.
